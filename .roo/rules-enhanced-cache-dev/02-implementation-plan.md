# Implementation Plan

- **Context‑Aware Similarity**: Augment query embeddings with metadata about prior conversation turns (context chain ID) before retrieval. Maintain a window of recent turns and use it to bias similarity scoring.
- **PCA Compression**: Train and fit a PCA model once a sufficient number of embeddings have been collected. Store the learned components and compress embeddings at insert time. Always compare queries using compressed vectors.
- **Adaptive Tau Threshold**: Expose `tau` as a configurable parameter and perform per‑dataset sweeps to find optimal thresholds. Support optional federated aggregation hooks so threshold updates can be learned without introducing a hard dependency on federated libraries.
- **Stable Interfaces**: Keep public APIs stable by adding new adapters and wrappers rather than editing GPTCache internals. This facilitates easy upgrades and preserves backwards compatibility.
