- Keep retrieval based on cosine similarity over compressed embeddings.
- Annotate contextual queries with context chain identifiers and decline cache hit if chains differ.
- Add optional federated τ aggregator as a separable module; document privacy boundary.
- Cite and follow MeanCache patterns (context chain, PCA, adaptive τ) and extend GPTCache via adapters.
