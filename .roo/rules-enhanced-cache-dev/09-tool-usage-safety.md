- Before running any terminal command, Roo must explain what it will do in one line; destructive commands require explicit confirmation and must be gated behind SAFE=0.
- Disallow `sudo`, global git config edits, or writing outside workspace.
- Never open network ports; benchmarking must be local.
- If a command fails, stop, summarize, and propose a fixâ€”do not loop.
