**✅ Proven Architecture Pattern:**

```python
# Multi-layer caching implementation best practices
class OptimalCachingArchitecture:
    """Best practices for high-performance caching systems"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        # Layer 1: Query Memoization (Fastest)
        self.query_cache = LRUCache(
            maxsize=200,          # Small size for exact matches
            ttl_seconds=3600      # 1-hour expiration
        )
        
        # Layer 2: Response Cache (Fast)
        self.response_cache = LRUCache(
            maxsize=500,          # Medium size for similar responses
            ttl_seconds=1800      # 30-minute expiration
        )
        
        # Layer 3: Embedding Cache (Moderate)
        self.embedding_cache = LRUCache(
            maxsize=1000,         # Large size for computed embeddings
            ttl_seconds=7200      # 2-hour expiration
        )
        
        # Layer 4: Semantic Cache (Comprehensive)
        self.semantic_cache = self._initialize_semantic_cache()
    
    def get_cached_response(self, query, context=None):
        """Optimized retrieval with fallback layers"""
        # Try each layer in order of speed
        for cache_layer in [self.query_cache, self.response_cache, 
                           self.embedding_cache, self.semantic_cache]:
            result = cache_layer.get(query, context)
            if result:
                return result
        
        return None  # Cache miss - proceed to LLM
```

            'variance_threshold': 0.95,    # Maintain 95% variance
            'min_samples': 5,              # Support small datasets
            'max_components': None,        # Auto-determine based on data
            'training_frequency': 100      # Retrain every 100 samples
        }
    
    def adaptive_compression(self, embeddings):
        """Adaptive compression based on data characteristics"""
        n_samples, n_features = embeddings.shape
        
        # Adaptive component selection
        if n_samples < 50:
            # Small dataset: Conservative compression
            n_components = min(
                max(2, n_samples // 2),
                self.compression_config['target_dimensions'],
                n_features
            )
        else:
            # Large dataset: Aggressive compression
            n_components = min(
                self.compression_config['target_dimensions'],
                n_features
            )
