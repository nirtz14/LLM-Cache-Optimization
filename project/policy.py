"""
Threshold-based policy for semantic cache reuse.

This module defines a simple `ThresholdPolicy` class used to decide whether
 a cached response should be considered a valid match for a new query based
 on the cosine similarity of their embeddings.  The `tau` (\u03c4) parameter
 controls the minimum similarity required for a hit.

In a complete implementation, the similarity scores would come from an
embedding model such as SentenceTransformers, and the `accept` method
would be called with real cosine similarity values in the range [-1.0, 1.0].
For demonstration purposes, this class simply compares the provided
similarity against the configured threshold.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tau: float
        The similarity threshold; cached entries with similarity greater
        than or equal to `tau` are considered hits.
