"""
Semantic cache adapter skeleton.

This module defines a `SemanticCache` class that will act as a wrapper around
an underlying cache (e.g., GPTCache) to provide similarity thresholding and
context chain filtering.  At this stage the implementation uses a simple
Python dictionary to store cached entries and demonstrates how the
components defined in `policy.py` and `context.py` might be used.

    This class stores query results in an in-memory dictionary keyed by
    the query string and optional context ID.  When retrieving a cached
    entry it checks whether the stored response is similar enough
    (according to a provided `ThresholdPolicy`) and whether the context
    matches (according to `ContextChain.same_chain`).  In a complete
    implementation the keys would be embeddings and the values would
    include additional metadata; this version is intentionally simple.
